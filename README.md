# Uniform Stability of Adam Algorithm and its Effect on Generalization Error of Neural Networks
* We assessed our theoretical results in age estimation, image and node classification
* Theorems, Proofs, and the experiments on age estimation are submitted as an original paper to Amirkabir Journal of Mathematics and Computing for review. Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16464
