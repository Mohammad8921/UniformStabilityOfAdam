## Abstract
* We theoretically connected the Lipschitz constant and maximum value of a loss function to the generalization error of deep learning models trained by Adam and AdamW optimizers under the uniform stability theory.
* Using the theoretical results, we proposed a novel loss function for training deep classification models to improve generalization performance and overcome the over-fitting issue.
* We assessed our theorems in human age estimation based on face images.
* We trained deep neural networks using our new loss function in image and node classification problems in order to stabilize the output models and increase their accuarcy.
* The tools have been used are:
  - Python 3.7.8
  - SciPy 1.7.3
  - OpenCV 4.5.5
  - PyTorch 1.11
  - CUDA 11.3
  - Torchvision 0.12
  - PyTorch Geometric 2.1
